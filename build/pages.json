The examples are ordered by institution and then IIIF viewer; the [Mirador|https:\/\/projectmirador.org\/] based examples demonstrates calls for IIIF Manifests and the [OpenSeadragon or OSD|https:\/\/openseadragon.github.io\/] based examples demonstrates calls for IIIF info.json files.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n\t<a class=\"btn btn-outline-primary nav-button\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" id=\"all-examples\" role=\"button\" href=\".\/examples\">All Examples<\/a>\r\n\t<a class=\"btn btn-outline-primary nav-button\"  style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" id=\"flowers-example\" role=\"button\" href=\".\/viewer-combined-osd\/flowers\">Search: \"flowers\"<\/a>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Background<\/h4>\r\n<p>Within the National Gallery similar tools are used to provide access to a wide range of images held in different databases. A version of this Simple IIIF Discovery system is also used to provide a much simpler access to images, before they are entered into any of the databases, through a simple filename based search option, which is used to allow new images to be checked and signed off before they are fully processed and registered as assets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Summary<\/h4>\r\n<p>The system is based on a website requesting the details of IIIF images from a Simple IIIF Discovery end-point, based on a simple keyword search. The website does not need to understand the complexities of any underlying APIs, just the simple structure of the results returned by the end-point. The website then just needs to be able to reformat the IIIF results and feed them into a IIIF based viewer of choice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"figure\">\r\n  <a href=\"graphics\/useexample.svg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"graphics\/useexample.svg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Simple IIIF Discovery - Use Flow Diagram\"><\/a>\r\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">This flow diagram demonstrates the the basic relations of how a website calls data from an example Simple IIIF Discovery end-point - For a live editable version of the diagram see [HERE|https:\/\/research.ng-london.org.uk\/modelling\/?data=eJyFU8tu2zAQPMtA%2FmHhUwLk8Q0J%2BoABHwrHbc9rcmXRIbksuYoiwB%2FfpRzVLZoggAFb9MzszCx1d%2Fc1Y%2Bpg%2BwA3IJ0roB%2BMwEkcR%2FRQEhmn34ZDoCiKQYFMv3oqUirtcssJHliEwxVwBoT1Bi7X1Aps3L6TK2g9D2Ad7jOGaxUgsNRi76XOWm%2BaprlY%2FKRdcUKNi8b3lkrzKBgtZgur1eoL%2FHA0UC5N8mjoyLsDGTmTnmgcWKGFMJuueXQheToRP7li%2BJnyCJ%2BjvUnsojRHzRn3F4uPcNxL6qU0a1ejcntCbqhwn41a%2FOPjI6EOC0RWo8ttbVjGRFWOZoCW23sLO9LySs0N6DkSlLEIhVqqmzGHvsgENKIZQIWVUse71pGFAceqjEb9lQkQgV7Uf%2F0dOFPdo3p9gftvq9vlxeK9bKjQlLnKqGxftRr9V5dWoOUcUIRyc1QbnN9XOQefuYEELQpOCfcwOOk0gVf%2B1Ig%2BUj6pBIyupXqu8WPLt4fCEb5v1kVt%2F2%2BlJbJFL%2BbpXPjtC%2FQW82zy%2FlSlFm%2ByS1o5Jtz5aVeCT7XCenm1FtsbbcX%2FkzrPqaEuMNPrgFdWUEvT3qxVpnVZL44fNZge647wGZ2fZv3l9nruQw0mzFND1YDJhPXtnJ%2BH02tQi5pWbMeIwRn0OqAW7OI0wivNjuAZq4WEe1r%2BBgpGZuQ%3D]<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>For general feedback and suggestions please use the \"Feedback\" option on the right.

These can offer a wide range of options and can be used as the basis of new collection presentations or even cross collection search options.

As the results of the search are determined by information provided in the file structure of each institution, the information returned from a search may not be exhaustive nor representative of the entirety of an institution's holdings; however, Simple IIIF Discovery may serve as a starting point for initial enquiries into the collections held by the participating institutions.<\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Please note that copyright and reproduction permissions are maintained by each participating institution for their own objects, and rights must be obtained in accordance with the conditions imposed by those institutions. Information about a given holding institution, when executing a combined search, will be available in returned IIIF manifests or via the links provided when working with simple IIIF info.json files. \r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgement<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This development of the Simple IIIF Discovery project has been directly supported by the following projects:<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<h4>The SSHOC Project<\/h4>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\">\t\r\n  <img style=\"height:64px;\" src=\"graphics\/sshoc-logo.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"The SSHOC Project\">\r\n  <img style=\"height:32px;\" src=\"graphics\/sshoc-eu-tag2.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"The SSHOC Project\">\r\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Social Sciences & Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC)is a project funded by the EU framework programme Horizon 2020 and unites [20 partner organisations and their 27 associates|https:\/\/www.sshopencloud.eu\/partners] in developing the social sciences and humanities area of the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)|http:\/\/www.eosc-portal.eu\/] - [SSHOC|https:\/\/www.sshopencloud.eu\/]<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<h4>The IIIF - TANC Project<\/h4>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\">\r\n  <img style=\"height:64px;\" src=\"graphics\/TANC - IIIF.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"IIIF - TANC\">\r\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">AHRC funded - IIIF-TNC | Practical applications of IIIF as a building block towards a digital National Collection -   [IIIF - TNC|https:\/\/tanc-ahrc.github.io\/IIIF-TNC]<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>For general feedback and suggestions please use the \"Feedback\" option on the right.
