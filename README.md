# iiif-discovery
A development of the Simple-Site system to provide examples of Simple IIIF Discovery End-points.

This code demonstrates generic public examples of a Simple IIIF Discovery system, based on tools used within the National Gallery to provide access to images from multiple institutions and present them together in IIIF compatible viewers.

The system is based on a website requesting the details of IIIF images from a Simple IIIF Discovery end-point, based on a simple keyword search. The website does not need to understand the complexities of any underlying APIs, just the simple structure of the results returned by the end-point. The website then just needs to be able to reformat the IIIF results and feed them into a IIIF based viewer of choice.
